Agentica
Overall Impression
Agentica presents a general-purpose agent platform or system for orchestrating tasks. Judges appreciated the ambition but noted that the scope may be too broad without a clearly defined primary use case.
What’s Working Well
Flexible architecture
 The system appears adaptable to multiple use cases.
Ambitious vision
 A general agent framework has broad applicability.
Technical exploration of agent patterns
 Demonstrates experimentation with agent orchestration.
Key Challenges to Address
Lack of focused use case
 Broad scope makes it harder to evaluate value.
Unclear differentiation
 Similar frameworks already exist.
Demonstration clarity
 It may not be obvious what the system does in practice.
Suggested Next Steps
Define a specific primary use case or vertical.
Provide a clear demo of one complete workflow.
Highlight unique architectural innovations.
Improve documentation and explanation of system behavior.
Strategic Considerations
Is this a developer tool or end-user product?
What core feature makes it stand out among agent frameworks?



Raw Comments

The solution addresses a niche problem space with clear potential for expansion into adjacent domains. The explanation of LLM usage, agent orchestration, and chain-of-thought reasoning was thorough and well-presented.
However, the technical narrative would benefit from being more explicitly tied to the business value it delivers. Currently, the connection between the technology and the tangible outcomes for end users could be made more direct.
The problem statement requires further refinement. The pitch oscillated between positioning the product as a CRM for global trade and presenting it as a broader integration solution. A clearer, more focused value proposition would strengthen the overall narrative and help judges and stakeholders understand the core offering.
Positives:
Solid problem statement which is a big pain point for a lot of the folks in the import/export business which deals with this on a regular basis. Some of the key features of RAG were evident in the demo which covered the classification part
Opportunities:
Demo was way longer than allowed so probably a lot of the features were not available in the first 3 min. Also, it was not clear on the user onboarding since there was an upload feature which was not clear if the user can upload something and does that become a part of the process.
Good work for the hackathon!!
Hybrid RAG (vector + BM25 + cross-encoder re-ranking) well-motivated for structured tariff data. Deterministic guardrails engine (no LLM) for tariff warnings prevents hallucination. Auto model fallback (70B→8B) on quota exhaustion is elegant. Live USITC API validation against retrieved text is a dual-source truth check. Amazing implementation.
Agentica is a strong agentic AI solution for global trade, addressing the complexity of rapidly changing customs regulations. Its capabilities across compliance, supply notifications, and CRM integration make it highly practical and valuable for real-world enterprise use.
Agentica project shows the technical depth and domain-specific intelligence - specifically in regulatory complexity. I love the idea of ensuring accuracy through hybrid retrieval. The nomination stands out in innovation.
Trade compliance is a real pain point, and the move from classification to downstream actions is compelling, but trust and evaluation depth still need work.
Outstanding depth for a hackathon build. An agentic CRM for global trade that classifies products into HTS tariff codes, calculates landed costs, generates compliance documents, and orchestrates 18 MCP-style tool calls across documents, communications, regulatory, and enterprise integrations. The hybrid RAG pipeline (vector + BM25 + cross-encoder re-ranking) is genuinely sophisticated, and they included benchmark results showing model comparison across difficulty levels. Real data sources (USITC API, CBP CROSS rulings), live duty rate validation to prevent hallucination, country-aware guardrails, and integrations with SAP/Zoho/QuickBooks. Targets a $2T+ compliance bottleneck with clear business rationale. Impressive scope and execution.
